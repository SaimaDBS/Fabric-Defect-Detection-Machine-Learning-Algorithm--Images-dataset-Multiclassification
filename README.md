# Fabric-Defect-Detection-Machine-Learning-Algorithm--Images-dataset-Multiclassification
Abstract 
In textile industry, manual fabric quality inspection is a challenging task. A quality inspector keeps an eye on the fabric for several hours. Incomplete and faulty inspection compromises cost and quality of the product. Various complex machine learning algorithms developed so far have certain limitations including real time implementation. An automatic machine learning algorithm is required that should be accurate and fast for real-time detection in industrial setup. This research has successfully developed a simple Convolutional Neural Network machine learning algorithm. It was experimented on three different sizes of images i.e., 200x800, 150x700 and 245x345. It was found out that image size has a great impact on the performance of the model. The developed CNN model gave the best performance with small image size of 245x345. A method is proposed to deploy the algorithm and automate the whole process of quality inspection in the textile industry.
